# Security-issues-in-Near-Field-Communication
RF FINGERPRINTING USING DEEP LEARNING, CNN
AIM:
• To identify the security issues in NFC
• Analyse the methods to solve the security related issues in NFC
• Vulnerabilities of RFID enabled NFC.
• Analyse the security algorithms that can be used
• To find the best solution using deep learning

OUTCOMES:
The outcomes that will be produced from this project are:
1. Understood the working principle behind the NFC
2. Analysed the security issues in near field communication.
3. Implemented deep learning for analysing the Radio Frequency signals.

METHODOLOGY USED:
Implementation of deep learning for the classification of Radio Frequency
signals, which helps us to prevent masquerade attacks in wireless
communication.
